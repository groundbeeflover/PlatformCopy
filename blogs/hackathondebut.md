# 🎉 Hackathon Team Debut! 

We are proud to announce that MaaSec’s Hackathon Team had their very first appearance in the hackathon scene at SURF Quantum Hackathon 2025 in Amsterdam!

Over an intense 24 hours, our team developed a prototype for a quantum-secure voting kiosk, exploring how Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) could be used to protect real-time encrypted communication on SURF’s national quantum network.

The system featured a modern web interface built with ReactJS, TailwindCSS, and TanStack, powered by a FastAPI backend and secured with advanced cryptographic protocols, all while navigating the challenges of emerging quantum infrastructure.

The project was met with great feedback for its technical ambition, thoughtful design, and potential real-world application.

We’re proud of our team for pushing boundaries and stepping confidently into the world of hackathons. More to come. 🚀
